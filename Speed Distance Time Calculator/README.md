# 🏎️ Speed-Distance-Time Calculator

## Project Overview

The **Speed-Distance-Time Calculator** is a simple, user-friendly multi-page web application that helps users calculate speed, distance, or time based on the inputs they provide. The calculator uses the basic formula:

- **Speed** = Distance / Time
- **Distance** = Speed × Time
- **Time** = Distance / Speed

The app provides a clean interface for quick calculations, making it an excellent tool for anyone needing to calculate travel times, speeds, or distances.

## 🚀 How to Use

1️⃣ Open the **`index.html`** file in your web browser to launch the calculator.  
2️⃣ The application has **three pages**: one for calculating **Speed**, one for **Distance**, and one for **Time**.  
3️⃣ On each page:
   - **Speed Page**: Enter Distance and Time to calculate Speed.
   - **Distance Page**: Enter Speed and Time to calculate Distance.
   - **Time Page**: Enter Distance and Speed to calculate Time.
4️⃣ After entering the appropriate values, click the **Calculate** button to see the result.  
5️⃣ You can navigate between pages to make different calculations.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

📌 Planned Features:  
- **Error Handling**: Add input validation for ensuring correct data (e.g., no negative or zero values).  
- **Mobile Support**: Improve the design for better use on mobile devices.  
- **Unit Conversion**: Allow users to select between different units for speed (km/h, m/s, etc.) and distance (miles, kilometers).  
- **History Tracking**: Allow users to save previous calculations for reference.
