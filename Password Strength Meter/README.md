# 🔐 Password Strength Meter

🌐 **Live Demo**: [Password Strength Meter](https://atharvapatharkar.github.io/web-development-projects/Password%20Strength%20Meter/index.html)

**Password Strength Meter** is a web application that checks the strength of a password and categorizes it as **Weak**, **Average**, or **Strong** based on its content. The app helps users assess whether their password meets the required criteria for secure authentication.

- **Weak**: Passwords consisting of just letters (either uppercase or lowercase).  
- **Average**: Passwords with a combination of letters and numbers.  
- **Strong**: Passwords with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
