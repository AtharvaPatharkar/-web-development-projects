# 🏆 Score-Keeper Game

## Project Overview

In this project, users can keep track of the score for a **2-player game**. The game has a maximum score of 11, and after every game, the score is reset. The buttons will change color to indicate the winner (green) and the loser (red) once the game is over. After a player wins, the score cannot be increased, and an alert message will notify the user of the winner.
