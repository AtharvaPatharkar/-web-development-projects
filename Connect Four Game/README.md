# 🎲 Connect Four

A **two-player game** where players compete to connect four bubbles in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to form a sequence of four wins the game! This is a local multiplayer game, meaning both players need to be present on the same device since the multiplayer feature over the network is not available.
