# 🔄 String Palindrome Checker

## Project Overview

The **String Palindrome Checker** is a simple web application that checks whether the entered word is a **palindrome** or not. Additionally, it calculates the **length of the string**. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam").

## 🌟 Use of the Project

The **String Palindrome Checker** allows the user to:
- **Enter a word** into the input field.
- The app will **calculate the length** of the string.
- The app will also check if the string is a **palindrome** and display a message accordingly (e.g., "Palindrome" or "Not a palindrome").

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 📄 **HTML5**: Provides the structure and layout for the palindrome checker interface.
- 🎨 **CSS3**: Styles the page and makes the interface user-friendly.
- 🧑‍💻 **JavaScript**: Handles the logic to check if the entered word is a palindrome and to calculate the string length.

## 🚀 How to Use

1️⃣ Open the **`index.html`** file in your web browser.  
2️⃣ Enter a **word** into the input field.  
3️⃣ The app will:
   - Display the **length** of the entered word.
   - Check if the word is a **palindrome** and show a corresponding message ("Palindrome" or "Not a palindrome").
4️⃣ You can enter any string and check if it satisfies the palindrome condition.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

📌 Planned Features:  
- **Ignore spaces and punctuation**: Update the logic to handle phrases (e.g., "A man a plan a canal Panama").  
- **Case Insensitivity**: Make the palindrome check case-insensitive (e.g., "Madam" would also be a palindrome).
- **Multiple word checks**: Allow users to input multiple words or phrases at once.
