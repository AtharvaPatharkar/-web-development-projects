# 🪨 Paper-Scissors Game

## Project Overview

The **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** is a simple and fun web game where the user plays against the computer. The game lets the user choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and then compares the user's choice with the computer's random choice to determine the winner.
